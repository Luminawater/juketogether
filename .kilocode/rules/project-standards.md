# Project Rules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer const over let when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

## File Organization
- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Keep tests next to the files they test

## Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Update README.md when adding new features
